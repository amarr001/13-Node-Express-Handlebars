# Burger Logger (Node-Express-Handlebars)
 Burger logger created by using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The user input names of burgers they'd like to eat and can choose to devour those burgers later after submiting them. The app will store every burger added in the database, whether devoured or not
 
# Installation 
 `npm install express` and `npm install mysql`  
 
# How to use 
 In your command line type `node server.js`, open the browser and copy the local host url plus the PORT returned to you. Open the page, add a burger you'd like to eat and click the save button. Check in you database if the burger has been added.
